# AIMwithMATLAB_team_giannis
In this hackathon, our aim was to get training data for our model, while taking part in different activities, via MATLAB Mobile.
The model gets inputed data from 4 different activities (walking, jogging, runniing, making jumps), and categorizes each activity via the "Acceleration" Variable changes.

The purpose, which we didnt manage to accomplish in time, was for the OUTPUT.mlx file, to be able to "read" any new data, and categorize the activities the user takes part in, via the knn function.
